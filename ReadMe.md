# FlexiCAN
The FlexiCAN device, developed by VinCSS, is an innovative automotive CAN solution designed for flexibility and ease of use. It features a unique software-controlled hot-swappable semiconductor switching matrix, enabling users to dynamically reconfigure the CAN_H and CAN_L pins of the CAN bus to any pin on the OBD-II port. This eliminates the need for proprietary connection cables, allowing seamless routing to non-standard or hidden CAN bus ports present on the OBD-II interface. Key highlights include software-configurable termination resistors (120Î©), support for CANFD up to 5 Mbit/s, and compatibility with both 11-bit (CAN 2.0A) and 29-bit (CAN 2.0B active) identifiers. The device supports high-speed CAN (ISO 11898-2 compliant) up to 1 Mbit/s and is fully compatible with Linux and CANSocket for robust integration. Its plug-and-play installation and fast, flexible command execution make it user-friendly, while the upcoming silent mode ensures non-intrusive analysis capabilities, making it ideal for automotive diagnostics and research applications.

# Firmware

There are two controllers in FlexiCAN: RP2040 and STM32.

RP2040 is to control FlexiCAN & OBD-II switch.

STM32 is to control CAN interface

Source code of STM32 we use from this link https://github.com/candle-usb/candleLight_fw

# Submitting pull requests

Each commit must not contain unrelated changes (e.g. functional and whitespace changes)
Project must be compilable (with default options) and functional, at each commit.
Squash any "WIP" or other temporary commits.
Make sure your editor is not messing up whitespace or line-ends.
We include both a .editorconfig and uncrustify.cfg which should help with whitespace.

# Acknowledgment:

FlexiCAN is built upon the foundation of many other excellent open-source projects. We would like to express our gratitude to the following contributors:

Thank you [@sakumisu](https://github.com/sakumisu) for the projects:
