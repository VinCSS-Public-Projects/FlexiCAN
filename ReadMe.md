# FlexiCAN
The FlexiCAN device, developed by VinCSS, is an innovative automotive CAN solution designed for flexibility and ease of use. It features a unique software-controlled hot-swappable semiconductor switching matrix, enabling users to dynamically reconfigure the CAN_H and CAN_L pins of the CAN bus to any pin on the OBD-II port. This eliminates the need for proprietary connection cables, allowing seamless routing to non-standard or hidden CAN bus ports present on the OBD-II interface. Key highlights include software-configurable termination resistors (120Î©), support for CANFD up to 5 Mbit/s, and compatibility with both 11-bit (CAN 2.0A) and 29-bit (CAN 2.0B active) identifiers. The device supports high-speed CAN (ISO 11898-2 compliant) up to 1 Mbit/s and is fully compatible with Linux and CANSocket for robust integration. Its plug-and-play installation and fast, flexible command execution make it user-friendly, while the upcoming silent mode ensures non-intrusive analysis capabilities, making it ideal for automotive diagnostics and research applications.

# Firmware

There are two controllers in FlexiCAN: RP2040 and STM32.

RP2040 is to control FlexiCAN & OBD-II switch.

STM32 is to control CAN interface
